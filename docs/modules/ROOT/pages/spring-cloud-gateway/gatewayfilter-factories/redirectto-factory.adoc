= `RedirectTo` `GatewayFilter` Factory

The `RedirectTo` `GatewayFilter` factory takes two parameters, `status` and `url`.
The `status` parameter should be a 300 series redirect HTTP code, such as 301.
The `url` parameter should be a valid URL.
This is the value of the `Location` header.
For relative redirects, you should use `uri: no://op` as the uri of your route definition.
The following listing configures a `RedirectTo` `GatewayFilter`:

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
      - id: prefixpath_route
        uri: https://example.org
        filters:
        - RedirectTo=302, https://acme.org
----

This will send a status 302 with a `Location:https://acme.org` header to perform a redirect.
